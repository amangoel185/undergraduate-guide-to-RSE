# Proposal

This proposal is a part of the original application for the [OLS-6](https://openlifesci.org/ols-6) Cohort.

## Title

## Project

**The Undergraduateâ€™s Guide To Research Software Engineering** aims to provide an *open-source*, *dynamic*, and *accessible* collection of resources on Research Software Engineering to undergraduates and newcomers interested in knowing more about the field.

The project aims to develop resources majorly around the following four areas:

1. **Information and Background of Research Software Engineering**

* This area would cover all the necessary context, history, background information, and the current situation of the Research Software Engineering movement across the world.

2. **Training and Education Resources**

* This area would cover all the necessary resources and materials to help develop skills required by a Research Software Engineer.
* It would cover existing resources as well as could be expanded to include new material.

3. **Job Board for Entry Level Positions**

* This area would primarily provide entry-level job listings in the field of Research Software Engineering and Open Science to lower the entry barrier for newcomers.

4. **Support and Community Engagement Resources**

* This area would provide support to newcomers in the form of open access community platforms as well as aim to provide help from experts on a case-to-case basis.

## Problem

Currently, the RSE community has a high entry barrier in terms of employment since most RSE positions require at least a Master's Degree or a PhD, or equivalent experience.

To tackle this problem, there has been a push in the RSE community to open up more entry-level positions. However, there exists a gap between the undergraduate students and the community itself in terms of a number of factors:

* Most undergraduate students are unaware of the RSE movement and are only aware of the typical routes such as typical software development roles, lab research or higher studies.
* A lot of students lack the skill set required in RSE positions since typical software development has different demands.
* There are a lot of existing resources for RSEs, but they can be overwhelming for students since they are designed for the community as a whole rather than newcomers.
* The community has extensive support available, but there is a lack of structure and networks for the students to tap into.

While the above list is non-exhaustive, the project aims to take a step forward in making it easier for students to navigate the Research Software Engineering movement and become a part of it.

## Achievements

I want to accomplish the following achievements during the OLS program:

* Collaborate successfully with the RSE community to develop the project.
* Develop a working prototype of the project covering all four areas.
* Spread awareness amongst undergraduate students and newcomers about RSE and help them develop the relevant skill set.
* Apply Open Science principles learnt during the program to the project successfully.
* Establish a community of people from all stages and walks of life across the RSE movement, especially one more conducive for newcomers.
* Establish a strong foundation for the project which is open to new contributors and can help develop the project beyond the program itself.
* Engage with different stakeholders in the RSE movement to help lower the entry barriers for newcomers.
