# The Undergraduate's Guide To Research Software Engineering

This is a project under the [OLS-6](https://openlifesci.org/ols-6) cohort.

## Vision Statement

I am working with students, newcomers, and research software engineers to build a collection of community resources on research software engineering so that newcomers can access to a structured set of resources and information, have a lower entry barrier to the RSE community, and it diversifies the community.
